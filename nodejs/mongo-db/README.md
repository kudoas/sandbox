# Module Summary

## NoSQL/MongoDB

- Alternative to SQL databases

- No strict schemas, fewer relations

- You can of course use schemas and reference-based relations but you got more flexibility

- Often, relations are alse created by embedding other documents/data

## Working with MongoDB

- Use the official MongoDB Driver

- Commands like insertOne(), find(), updatedone(), and deleteOne() make CRUD-operations very simple

- Check the official docs to learn about all available operations + configurations/operators

- All operations are promise-based, herce you can easily chain them for more complex flows
