# Model View Controller (MVC)

## Models

- Represent your data in your code
- Work with your data (e.g. save, fetch)

## Views

- What the users sees
- Decoupled from your application code

## Controllers

- Connecting your Models and your Views
- Contains the "in-between" logic
- Should only make sure that the two can communicate (in both directions)
