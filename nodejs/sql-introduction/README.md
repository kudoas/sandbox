# Module Summary

## SQL

- SQL uses strict data schemas and relations
- You can connect your Node.js app via packages like mysql2
- Writing SQL queries is not directly related to Node.js and something you have to learn in addition to Node.js

## Sequlize

- Instead of writing SQL queries manually, you can use packages (ORMs) like Sequelize to focus on the Node.js code and work with native JS objects
    Sequelize allows you define models and interact with the database through them
- You can also easily set up relations ("Associations") and interact with your related models through them
